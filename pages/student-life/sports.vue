        Whether you are a seasoned competitor, new to sport and exercise or
        simply just want to give something a go, then we can accommodate you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Great facilities, passionate professionals and a first class support
        network to help you engage in sport at any level will help you to both
        settle into life at {{ $app.city }} and enhance your student experience.
        <br />
        <br />

        The {{ $app.name }} recognises the importance of sport, fitness and
        health to its institutional mission and core values. Sport and fitness
        plays an integral part of this in ensuring that there is a pursuit of
        excellence, a distinctive student experience, inclusiveness and a
        supportive culture. We continue to develop and enhance our facilities,
        provision and support of sport to ensure that all students and staff are
        able to participate at appropriate levels to fulfil their sport and
        fitness needs and desires. <br />
        <br />

        We are also home to some of {{ $app.city }}'s sports clubs namely:
        {{ $app.city }} Football Club, {{ $app.city }} Rugby Club, City of
        {{ $app.city }} Swimming Club and {{ $app.city }} Hockey Club. By
        working closely with the Students Union, Sport and Exercise Sciences
        academic teams, the Grounds and Gardens department, and many other
        individuals, departments, groups and agencies, we aim to continue to
        enhance the sporting profile of the University.
