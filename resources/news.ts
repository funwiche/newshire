By 75, only 28% of women and 48% of men are meeting recommended physical activity levels, excluding walking. This paints a concerning picture, especially considering the stark gender gap: nearly 70% of women over 75 are inactive.<p>The study, led by University of the ${$app.name}, analysed data from the Scottish Health Survey and Scottish Household Survey, alongside participation figures from Parkrun events.</div></div></div></section><section class=m-fullwidthquote><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-xs-12><blockquote>This research shines a light on the alarming decline in active ageing, which carries significant health consequences for our older population.

My husband doesn’t play golf – he walks up mountains. We took up bowls because we wanted to do something together, so we started at the same time and are both actively involved with the club. It\'s fantastic to see how sport brings people together and helps people feel less isolated. I’ve introduced lots of people from my golf club to bowls, it’s a very sociable sport and it’s not too strenuous.

Universities have made major strides towards the 20% target, hitting interim milestones in 2021 and introducing the most progressive admissions policies in the UK, in support of this goal.<p>However, with six years remaining to reach the targets in 2030 progress has plateaued in the face of mounting challenges including the legacy of lost-learning in schools during the pandemic, a cost-of-living crisis, and the persistent attainment gap in schools.<p>The success of students like Wayne, Jamie and Mia is testament to the extraordinary role university can play for those who face significant barriers to accessing higher education. The stories behind each of the “40 Faces” serves as a reminder of the importance of this agenda and a rallying call to all stakeholders involved to refocus on working together for its achievement.<p>As Scotland\'s leading university for widening access, with 44.8% of their undergraduate students being the first in their family to attend university, ${$app.iso} firmly believes that education should be available to all. ${$app.iso} is a place where ability, not background, matters. The University firmly believes that education should be available for all, regardless of background or circumstance. ${$app.iso} champions and empowers individuals from diverse and non-traditional backgrounds to access higher education through various initiatives such as their Foundation Academy, strong articulation links with college students and their Student Success Model.<p>New polling, commissioned by Universities Scotland from Censuswide as part of the campaign, gives an insight into graduate attitudes towards widening access. When asked what factors are most important to widening access, over 600 graduates aged 24-40 who went to university in Scotland identified the following priorities:<ul><li>38% said diverse routes into university are important.<li>34% said that connections between schools, colleges and universities are key.<li>28% said increasing the amount of non-repayable grants and bursaries available to students during studies is important.<li>25% said investing more money in the education and wider support needs of each access student during their studies is important.<li>25% said improving attainment in schools is important to the access agenda.</ul><p>The polling data is a strong fit with the themes emerging from the lived experience as shared by the 40 Faces featured in the campaign. Four themes emerged most strongly, as key to making further progress. They are:<ul><li><strong>Start young on self-belief.</strong> Schools and universities must continue to cultivate a strong and inclusive sense of belonging amongst underrepresented communities.<li><strong>Join things up. </strong>Achievement of the 2030 goals will only be possible with a holistic approach that sees progress at school, college and university level, including significant progress in the poverty-related attainment gap in schools.<li><strong>No wrong path.</strong> Multiple routes into university need to be available to suit diverse needs and offer second chances and equal access to chances later in life.<li><strong>Money matters.</strong> From the perspective of student finance, which focused more on non-repayable grants and bursaries, and the funding available to universities to support access initiatives and investment on a per student basis.</ul><p>The “40 Faces” in the campaign reflect the diversity of underrepresented students including: students from the most deprived 20% of postcodes; those from low-participation schools; students with care experience and/or estranged from their families. It also includes mature learners, those who have progressed to university through a college route and those who have gone to university after years in the workforce.</div></div></div></section><section class=m-fullwidthquote><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-xs-12><blockquote>“Participation in Scotland’s universities is at its most inclusive, and Scotland’s 19 universities and higher education institutions have truly shifted the dial on widening access.
