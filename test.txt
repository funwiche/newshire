I am pleased to write this reference on behalf of Che Fidelis Funwi, who has worked as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Agricultural Research for Development (IRAD), specifically focusing on Post-Harvest Technology, for over eight years. During his time at IRAD, Che Fidelis Funwi has been an invaluable member of our team, contributing to critical research aimed at improving post-harvest handling, storage, and processing of agricultural products.

In his role, Che Fidelis Funwi has been responsible for conducting research on the quantification and analysis of losses at different post-harvest stages, such as harvesting, transportation, and storage; innovative technologies and methods to reduce post-harvest losses; developing low-cost, efficient storage systems for grains, fruits, and vegetables; controlled atmosphere (CA) and modified atmosphere (MA) storage systems; developing efficient and energy-saving drying techniques; and post-harvest training and capacity building. He has demonstrated strong technical skills in moisture content determination, colour and texture analysis, biochemical and nutritional testing, and microbial analysis, all of which have been instrumental in achieving the goals of our projects.

Che Fidelis Funwi has consistently shown keen attention to detail, ensuring that experiments and data collection processes are meticulously executed. His ability to analyse complex data and translate findings into actionable insights has significantly enhanced our understanding of post-harvest challenges and potential solutions.

Beyond his technical competencies, Che Fidelis Funwi is also an excellent team player. He works effectively with both colleagues and external stakeholders, and his communication skills have been key in disseminating research findings through reports, presentations, and collaborative meetings.

I have no doubt that Che Fidelis Funwi will excel in any future academic or research role he pursues and will be a strong asset to Teesside University. I wholeheartedly recommend him for postgraduate studies without reservation.
